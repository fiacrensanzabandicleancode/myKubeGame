# game5

The 2 folders in this folder are 2 examples given by Amigoscode in his tutorial with Nana on youtube.
One folder contain a minimal dockerfile. Another contains a minimal docker file 2, but it has a bit more lines. If we can say that 5 lines is a bit more compared to 2 lines. But hey I'm on my way to crash docker & k8s.
